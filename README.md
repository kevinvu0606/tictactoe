<Just play>

Plan:
1. Setup basic HTML + CSS to make it visible
2. grid to be made up of divs - need to find a way to add numbers to each index
3. have solutions set as an array
4. .addeventListener to all the grids so that when we click we run a function (player click)
5. per each click the function will assign an X 
6. after each click the function will also check to see if a win-solution has been reached by comparing to our original solutions listed in an array . We can use a loop here to compare the state of the board to our "solutions"
7. If it matches we dislpay a message
8. if we dont match, continue the game
9. Also change the assignement from X - > 0
